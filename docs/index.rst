****************

DbgScript is a multi-script debugger extension.

More precisely, it is a `DbgEng extension`_ that allows the embedding of
arbitrary scripting languages into the `Debugging Tools for Windows`_.

It offers an extensibility model allowing new languages to be added with no
changes to the core.

DbgScript extends scripting languages with a API that models
elements in the target process like threads, C/C++ objects, stack frames, etc.

For example, in the Python Script Provider, a thread is modelled as a
Thread object with various attributes and methods that can obtain further
information about it, such as its call stack.

DbgScript comes with three first-party providers: `Python`_, `Ruby`_ and `Lua`_.

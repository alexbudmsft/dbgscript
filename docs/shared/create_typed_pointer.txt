Create a pointer to a :class:`TypedObject` from an address and type. Specify
the base type for ``type``. E.g. for an ``int*``, pass ``int``. This works for
arbitrary buffers; arrays included.
   
.. note::

   Prefer using the fully-qualfied type name (i.e. including the module prefix)
   as it will accelerate symbol lookup dramatically. I.e. ``module!Foo``, not
   ``Foo``.
